# Machine-Learning-Web-App-with-Streamlit-and-Python
Using Python and Streamlit built this  interactive ML web app! We are going to load, explore, visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards in less than 100 lines of Python code! Tihs web application will allows users to choose what classification algorithm they want to use and let them interactively set hyper-parameter values, all without them knowing to code!
